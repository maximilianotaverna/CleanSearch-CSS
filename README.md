# Note
'Product Sans' is under the google product sans license. Hence, it is not Open Source, and is strictly not for any use other than in the google logo. This is strictly not for commercial use. However, there are other free typefaces which resemble Product Sans. 'Questrial' is used as a free replacement unless you have product sans already installed locally.
